第三章
```
It smelled of hay (干草) and it smelled of manure (肥料, 粪肥).
It smelled of the perspiration (汗水) of tired horses (疲惫的马) and the wonderful (美妙的) sweet breath (甜美的呼吸) of patient (温顺的) cows (奶牛).
It smelled of grain (谷物) and of harness dressing (马具保养油) and of axle grease (轴承润滑油) and of rubber boots (橡胶靴) and of new rope (新绳子).
But mostly it smelled of hay (干草), for there was always hay in the great loft (阁楼) up overhead (在上方).
And there was always hay being pitched down (扔下) to the cows (奶牛) and the horses (马) and the sheep (羊).
And it was pleasantly (令人愉快地) cool in summer (夏天) when the big doors (大门) stood wide open (敞开) to the breeze (微风).
The barn (谷仓) had stalls (畜栏) on the main floor (主层) for the workhorses (役马), tie-ups (拴住的地方) on the main floor for the cows (奶牛), a sheepfold (羊圈) down below (下面) for the sheep (羊), a pigpen (猪圈) down below for Wilbur.
Ladders (梯子), grindstones (磨刀石), pitchforks (干草叉), monkey wrenches (活动扳手), scythes (镰刀), lawn mowers (割草机), snow shovels (铲雪铲), ax handles (斧柄), milk pails (奶桶), water buckets (水桶), empty grain sacks (空谷物袋), and rusty rat traps (生锈的捕鼠器).
It was the kind of barn (谷仓) that swallows (燕子) like to build their nests (筑巢) in.
Directly underneath (正下方) the cows (奶牛).
Mr. Zuckerman knew that a manure pile (粪堆) is a good place to keep a young pig (小猪).
An old milking stool (挤奶凳) that had been discarded (被丢弃).
And she placed (放置) the stool (凳子) in the sheepfold (羊圈) next to (旁边) Wilbur's pen (围栏).
Get into (进入) the pigpen (猪圈).
But he told Fern that she could sit on the stool (凳子) and watch Wilbur as long as (只要) she wanted to.
One afternoon (一个下午) in June (六月).
He wandered (漫步) out into his small yard (小院子) outside the barn (谷仓).
He found a small strip (小块) of potato skin (土豆皮) and ate it.
His back (背部) itched (发痒).
So he leaned against (倚靠) the fence (篱笆) and rubbed (摩擦) against the boards (木板).
He walked indoors (走进屋内), climbed (爬上) to the top (顶部) of the manure pile (粪堆).
One of the boards (木板) is loose (松动的).
In a minute he had squeezed (挤过) through the fence (篱笆) and was standing in the long grass (长草) outside his yard (院子).
The goose (鹅) chuckled (咯咯笑).
Wilbur felt queer (奇怪的) to be outside (在外面) his fence (围栏).
"Go down through (穿过) the orchard (果园), root up (刨出) the sod (草皮)! Go down through the garden (花园), dig up (挖出) the radishes (萝卜)! Root up everything (刨出所有东西)!"
"Look for (寻找) corn (玉米)!"
"Skip (跳跃) and dance (舞蹈), jump (跳) and prance (欢腾)!"
"Go down through the orchard (果园) and stroll (漫步) in the woods (树林)!"
He gave a jump (跳跃) in the air, twirled (旋转), ran a few steps (跑了几步), stopped (停下), looked all around (四处张望), sniffed (嗅闻) the smells (气味) of afternoon (下午), and then set off walking (开始走) down through the orchard (果园).
He put his strong snout (强壮的猪鼻子) into the ground (地面) and began pushing (推), digging (挖), and rooting (刨).
He had plowed up (犁开) quite a piece of ground (一块地) before anyone noticed (注意到) him.
The goose (鹅) heard the racket (喧闹声) and she, too, started hollering (大喊).
"Run-run-run downhill (下坡), make for (跑向) the woods (树林)!"
The cocker spaniel (可卡犬) heard the commotion (骚动) and he ran out (跑出) from the barn (谷仓) to join the chase (加入追逐).
Mr. Zuckerman heard (听到) and he came out (出来) of the machine shed (机器棚) where he was mending (修理) a tool (工具).
Came up from the asparagus patch (芦笋地) where he was pulling (拔) weeds (杂草).
"I'll go and get a bucket (桶) of slops (泔水)."
The news (消息) of Wilbur's escape (逃跑) spread rapidly (迅速传播) among the animals (动物们) on the place (农场).
The horses (马) in their stalls (畜栏) in the barn (谷仓) pricked up their ears (竖起耳朵) when they heard the goose (鹅) hollering (大喊).
Every animal (每只动物) stirred (骚动) and lifted its head (抬起头) and became excited (变得兴奋) to know that one of his friends (朋友之一) had got free (获得自由) and was no longer (不再) penned up (关在围栏里) or tied fast (被绑住).
"I believe (我相信) I'd rather (我宁愿) be penned up (被圈起来) in my own yard (自己的院子)!"
And now Mr. Zuckerman was coming down (走下来) toward him (朝他走来) carrying (拿着) a pail (桶).
"Dodge about (四处闪躲), dodge about!"
"Skip around (四处跳跃), run toward me (跑向我), slip in and out (进进出出), in and out, in and out! Make for (跑向) the woods (树林)! Twist (扭转) and turn (转向)!"
The cocker spaniel (可卡犬) sprang (扑向) for Wilbur's hind leg (后腿).
Lurvy reached out (伸出手) and grabbed (抓住).
Wilbur dodged (躲闪).
Lurvy missed (没抓住) Wilbur and grabbed (抓住) the spaniel (可卡犬) instead (而不是).
"Run downhill (跑下坡)!" suggested (建议) the cows (奶牛).
Wilbur heard (听到) the words of praise (赞美的话).
He felt the pleasant (愉快的) rubbing (摩擦) of the stick (棍子) along his itchy back (发痒的背).
